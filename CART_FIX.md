# Cart Authentication Bug Fix

## 🐛 Issue Identified
When users were not logged in, they could still:
- Add items to cart (which would show success toasts)
- See cart count in navbar badge
- Navigate to cart page with items

This created a confusing UX where users thought they had items in cart but couldn't proceed to checkout.

## ✅ Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Authentication Required for Cart Actions**
- Modified `handleAddToCart` functions in both `Index.tsx` and `Bundles.tsx`
- Now shows "Login required" error toast when unauthenticated users try to add items
- Button text changes to "Login to Order" when not authenticated

### 2. **Navbar Cart Count Fix**
- Cart count badge only shows when user is authenticated
- `cartItemCount = isAuthenticated ? getCartItemCount() : 0`

### 3. **Auto-Clear Cart on Logout**
- Added Supabase auth state listener to cart provider
- Cart automatically clears when user signs out
- Prevents cart state persistence across login sessions

### 4. **Consistent Behavior Across Pages**
- Applied same authentication checks to:
  - Homepage service cards
  - Bundles page
  - Any other cart-related functionality

## 🚀 Result
- No more confusing cart behavior for unauthenticated users
- Clear call-to-action: users must login to purchase services
- Cart state properly managed across authentication changes
- Better UX flow: login → browse → add to cart → checkout

## 📝 Technical Details
- Added authentication checks before `addToCart()` calls
- Enhanced cart provider with auth state management
- Improved error messaging for better user guidance
- Maintained existing functionality for authenticated users
